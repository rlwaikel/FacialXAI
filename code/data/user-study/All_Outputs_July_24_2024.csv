To what extent did the saliency maps and the region relevance scores influence your decision? Do you have any suggestions to us on how to improve the visual explanations? Please enter your response in the text box below.",Do you have a few more minutes to look at average saliency maps to give us your thoughts?,"Above are average saliency maps for each condition.  The average saliency map is an average of hundreds of images with the same condition. The pixels the AI tool finds to be most important in classifying a genetic condition are in yellow. The brighter the area on the face, the more important the pixel is in the AI tool classification. Please take a moment to look through the images.
