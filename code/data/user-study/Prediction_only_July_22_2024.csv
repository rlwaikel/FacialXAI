A saliency map is another type of AI output that allows us to visualize which pixels the AI finds important in classifying or diagnosing an image. The average saliency map is an average of hundreds of images with the same condition. The pixels the AI tool finds to be most important in classifying a genetic condition are in yellow. The brighter the area on the face, the more important the pixel is in the AI tool classification. Please take a moment to look through the images.
